# ROS-project
This package controls the autonomous working of the two robotic manipulators working in a warehouse system integrated with IOT. The main function carried out is the detection of packages and handling the incoming orders via IOT protocols and then despatching and shipping the packages. Also notifying the customer the statuses of their orders via email.
It has 3 packages:
1: pkg_task5 : It contains all the scripts to work both the manipulaters
2: pkg_ros_iot_bridge: This contains the scripts to act as an intermediator between the ROS environment and the IOT environment
3: vb_simulation_pkgs: This contains all the URDF and SRDF files that are used to create the enviornment.
